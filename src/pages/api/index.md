## Overview
Globalization Content Service APIs are divided into four categories: admin, asset, project, and task.

### Admin-related APIs
- Onboard a new enterprise to Globalization Content Service. Register a new organization or retrieve an existing organization.
- Authenticate a user by getting IMS orgs and groups for the specified userToken.
- Add or retrieve content systems, products, locales, service providers, or workflows.
- Find assets and get scoping reports.
### Asset-related APIs
- Get all assets for specified projects and tasks. Dive deeper and retrieve asset details that include info on locales, projects, tasks, and Org Id. 
- Based on where you are in the localization workflow, you can update an asset, preview an asset, and then update and complete the asset or cancel the asset and restart localization process.
### Project-related APIs
- Create or update a new project. 
- Get a list of all projects that you can access or dive deeper and get the project details. 
- Plan your work by getting all projects with task counts.
### Task-related APIs
- Create, retrieve, or update a task.
- Want to plan how many tasks you have, easy get a list of all tasks.
- Fine-tune your search by looking for assets or tasks that meet certain criteria, such as locale, project name, status, or workflow. You can also zoom in on a task and retrieve more information.
- Create a new task asynchronously for batch processing or out of sync scheduled localization tasks. Update these tasks asynchronously.

> **Note**: See Globalization Content Service **API Cheat Sheet** for a list of all APIs, including their path, parameters, method, and responses.

# APIs for Globalization Partners

A localization partner typically uses two types of APIs. 

### One time setup
Register to Globalization Content Service and setup a task polling framework/connector. See [how to register to Globalization Content Service](../partner/index.md#partner-onboarding-the-complete-workflow).

### APIs for continual localization
These include:
* [Get all assets for the project](#get-all-assets-api)
* [Download Individual Asset](#download-asset-api)
* [Manual Translation of Downloaded Asset](#mt-download-asset-api)
* [Upload Translated xliff to GCS Azure Storage](#upload-asset-api)
* [Initiate Asset Locale Completion in GCS](#complete-asset-api)
* [Cancel Existing Assets API](#cancel-existing-assets-api)


[](#_Update_Service_Provider_1)In the section below, you will learn about these APIs.

## Get All Assets API
This API finds all the assets for the specified project and task received in IO Event. It returns information such as locale name, strings to be localized, last modified information and metadata. 

`Path: /v1/projects/{project}/tasks/{task}/assets`
### Key Parameters
1. **orgId**: The IMS organization id associated with the client. 
1. **projectId**: The unique string of the project under which tasks are created
1. **taskId:** Unique string that defines the task name. 

### Request URL

```java
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://gcs.adobe.io/v1/projects/<projectId>/tasks/<taskId>/assets?orgId=<customer_org_id>' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJS....' \
  --header 'x-api-key: <client_id>'
```


### Responses
You get the following responses:

1. **200 OK**: The 200 OK status code indicates that the request has been processed successfully on the server
1. **401 Unauthorized**: The 401 unauthorized error status response code indicates that the request was not processed because the destination resource's authentication credentials were invalid. Reauthenticating with right credentials is recommended. 
1. **403 Forbidden**: The 403 Forbidden error status code indicates that the server has received the request but has refused to allow it. The client may have insufficient rights to a resource.
1. **404 Not Found**: The 404 error is returned when the server can’t find the requested resource. It could be broken or dead link because of file movements or entering a non-existent task name.
### Understanding the successful response
The following is the successful response with the 200 Response code.

```java
{
	"service": "GCS",
	"response": [
		{
			"name": "<taskName>",
			"assetId": "<assetId>",
			"sourceUrl": "https://gcsstorageprod.blob.core.windows.net/gcs/uploadFiles/<customer_org_id>/<AssetName>.json?sig=TsQ2n...eBQ%3D&se=2023-12-07T15%3A49%3A24Z&sv=2019-02-02&sp=r&sr=b",
			"status": "IN_TRANSLATION",
			"mimeType": "application/json",
			"createdDate": "2023-12-07T05:49:55.945Z",

					"createdDate": "2023-12-07T05:50:04.958Z",
					"urlType": "NORMALIZED"
				}
			]
		}
	],
	"success": true
}
```

Here are the key sections in the response:

- **assetId**: A unique ID that is used by the content system to track assets if needed.
- **orgId**: The IMS organization id associated with client creating the project and its assets
- **taskId**: A unique id for the translation task
- **projectId**: The id of the project containing the tasks
- **sourceURL**: Publicly available URLs (S3 or Azure) for downloading the source asset, can be located in response object with parameter "sourceUrl". This is just for reference and not to be consumed for translation process.
- **status**: 200 ok, indicating request has been executed successfully
- **mimeType**: Defines the nature and format of the asset (media type)
- **createdDate**: Date when the asset was created; represented in ISO 8601 spec; e.g. format 2021-08-05T18:35:58Z 
- **assetMetadata**: Details of the asset name and asset path 
- **assetLocale**: Information that helps define the source asset language. Details locale as fr-FR, status as Created and updatedDate value.
- **assetUrls/url**: It is important to note here is that the actual asset URL to be used by the partner for translation is the "url" parameter in the response object under "assetUrls", which is in NORMALIZED state. The unique object key to locate this asset is below,
```java
<customer_org_id>/<ProjectId>/<TaskId>/normalised/<AssetName>.json/en-US/<AssetName>.json.xlf
```

> **Note**: To know more about the Get Asset API, see [Get All Assets in Swagger](https://gcscore-dev-va7.stage.cloud.adobe.io/swagger-ui/index.html#/Asset%20Service/getAssetsUsingGET).

## Download individual asset
This Get API donwloads an existing asset for a particular object key.
Here, Object key referes to a location or unique path(in the GCS storage) for an asset.
### Request URL

```java
curl --request GET \
  --url 'https://gcs.adobe.io/v1/assetContent?orgId=<customer_org_id>&objectKey=<customer_org_id>/<ProjectId>/<TaskId>/normalized/<AssetName>.json/en-US/<AssetName>.json.xlf' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSU....' \
  --header 'x-api-key: <client_id>'
```
### Successful response
The following is the successful response which is a byte stream with the 200 Response code.

```java
Content of asset as byte array with Content-Type as	"application/octet-stream;charset=UTF-8"
```
## Manual translation of downloaded asset
Manual translation of xliff asset downloaded in the previous step, offline by the translator.

## Upload translated xliff to GCS Azure Storage
This Post API is used to upload the translated xliff to GCS Azure Storage (Partner can use their own storage and provide signed url which is accessible to GCS).

### Request URL

```java
curl --request POST \
  --url https://gcs.adobe.io/v1/uploadToStorage \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGci...O_meqYghG0IX5jA' \

	"service": "GCS Storage",
	"response": "https://gcs...blob.core.windows.net/gcs../uploadFiles/<customer_org_id>/<LocalizedAssetName>.xlf?sig=FTxG..LIw%3D&se=2023-11-29T18%3A30%3A29Z&sv=2019-02-02&sp=r&sr=b",
	"success": true
}
```
## Initiate asset locale completion in GCS
This Put API initiates asset locale completion for the specified asset and locale in GCS with manually translated asset url obtained in previous step. If a source asset is being translated in three locales, then you need to call this API three times to complete per asset per locale localization. 

When you call Update asset and initiate asset complete, Globalization Content Service runs the complete asset workflow that will finally convert the translated [XLIFF](#_A_Sample_XLiff) file into the original file format and save it in the asset repository. The customer will get a URL of the target locale asset.

> **Path**: /v1/projects/{project}/tasks/{task}/assets/{asset}/locales/{locale}/complete
### Key Parameters
1. **asset name**: Unique string identifying the asset name. 
1. **assetInfo**: A JSON object that describes asset properties. See the details of the assetinfo object below.
1. **locale**: Defines the target locale
1. **project:** Sets the project name.
1. **task:** Sets the task name. 

### Request URL

```java
curl --request PUT \
  --url https://gcs.adobe.io/v1/projects/<projectId>/tasks/<taskId>/assets/<assetName>/locales/<targetLocale>/complete \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUz...vCIXe11w' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
